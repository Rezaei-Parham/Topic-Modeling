A Jupyter Notebook project that uses linear algebra for topic modeling. This project was part of the Linear Algebra course at Sharif University in Fall 2022.

The project starts by tokenizing and stemming the words using the Natural Language Toolkit (nltk), then creating a term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf) data matrix. It then explores two methods for finding topics:
1. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
2. Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)

## Key Features
- Tokenizing and stemming words using the Natural Language Toolkit (nltk)
- Creating a term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf) data matrix
- Using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for topic modeling
- Using Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) for topic modeling

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Install the necessary dependencies
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook file and follow the steps outlined in the notebook

## Dependencies
- Numpy
- Pandas
