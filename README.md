# Topic Modeling using Linear Algebra in Python

A Jupyter Notebook project that uses linear algebra for topic modeling. This project was part of the Linear Algebra course at Sharif University in Fall 2022.

The project starts by tokenizing and stemming the words using the Natural Language Toolkit (nltk), then creating a term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf) data matrix. It then explores two methods for finding topics:
1. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
2. Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)

## Features
- Tokenizing and stemming words using nltk
- Creating a tf-idf data matrix
- Using SVD and PCA for topic modeling
- Using NMF for topic modeling

## Getting Started
To use this project, you will need to have a basic understanding of linear algebra, Python, and Jupyter Notebook. Once you have that, follow these steps to get started:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Install the necessary dependencies
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook file and follow the steps outlined in the notebook

## Dependencies
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Nltk
